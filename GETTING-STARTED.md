## FAQs

### Q: When can I use this in production?

**A**: The framework is in early development (Stage 0). Production-ready release is planned for late 2025 (Stage 5). Early adopters can test pre-release versions starting Stage 1.

### Q: How can I help if I'm not a developer?

**A**: Many ways! Documentation, spreading the word, providing feedback, testing, sharing use cases, and reporting issues all help tremendously.

### Q: Will this work with [my favorite AI framework]?

**A**: We're designing for compatibility with popular frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.). Integration examples will be provided in Stage 1+.

### Q: Is this only for Python?

**A**: Initial implementation is Python, but the principles and architecture can be applied to any language. Community ports are welcome!

### Q: Can I use this commercially?

**A**: Yes! It's AGPL-3.0, which means you can use it commercially if you open-source your modifications. For closed-source commercial use, contact us about commercial licensing.

### Q: How is this different from [other AI security tool]?

**A**: Zero-Trust AI is specifically designed with zero-trust principles for agentic AI systems. It's educational, open-source, and built for the emerging multi-agent ecosystem.
